    private void calculate() {
        BigDecimal runningTotal = new BigDecimal(0);
        int runningLoyaltyPoints = startingLoyaltyPoints;
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfSeats; i++) {
            if (runningLoyaltyPoints >= 10) {
                runningLoyaltyPoints = runningLoyaltyPoints - 10;
            } else {
                runningTotal.add(seatPrice);
                runningLoyaltyPoints++;
            }
        }
        this.finalPrice = runningTotal;
        this.finalLoyaltyPoints = runningLoyaltyPoints;
    }


Design issues:
We get a booking (number of seats, movie, movieGoer, price per seat)
Now we want to add loyalty points => price per seat and number of seats don't calculate the price

Price - loyalty points => final loyalty points
final price with loyalty discount

use loyalty points to store updated loyalty points

Price combination of loyalty points and money -> 10 loyalty points and five pounds
